    // - when a function is called, the arguments and local variables for that function are pushed
    // onto the stack, and the function returns, those variables are popeed of the stack.
    // - this makes stack allocation and deallocation very fast, since it is a simple and efficient
    // memory manegement strategy.
    //
    // # heap memory:
    // - is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation.
    // - is managed by the program itself.
    // - when a program need to allocate memory for a data structure whose size is not known at
    // compile time (such as vector), it requests memory from the operating system's heap.
    // - this memory must be explicitly deallocated by the program when it is no longer needed.
    // - since heap allocation and deallocation are more complex operations than stack process,
    // they are generally slower and more error-prone.
    //
    // # stack overflow error:
    // - occurs when a program tries to allocate more memory on the stach than is available.
    // - since stack is a finite region of memory, there is a limit to how much memory can be
    // allocated on the stack.
    // - if a function calls itself recursively too many times, for example, it may eventually run
    // out of stack space and cause a stack overflow error.
    // - when this happens, the program will usually crash or terminate with an error message:
    // _stack_overflow_error();
